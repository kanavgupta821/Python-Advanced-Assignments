However, what about an expression like 10 + obj which is really (10).__add__(myobj)? The 10 is an instance of a Python built-in type and its __add__ method doesn't know anything about the new type,obj, so it will return a error NotImplemented. To handle such scenarios, __radd__ is used. Python will first try (10).__add__(myobj), and if that returns NotImplemented, Python will check if the right-hand operand implements __radd__, and if it does, it will call obj.__radd__(10) rather than raising a TypeError."
