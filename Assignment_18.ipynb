        "### ANS A text file consists of human readable characters, which can be opened by any text editor.A text file can be understood as a sequence of charactersconsisting of alphabets, numbers and other special symbols. Files with extensions like .txt, .py, .csv, etc. are some examples of text files. When we open a text file using a text editor (e.g., Notepad), we see several lines of text. However, the file contents are not stored in such a way internally. Rather, they are stored in sequence of bytes consisting of 0s and 1s. On the other hand, binary files are made up of non-human readable characters and symbols, which require specific programs to access its contents. Binary files are also stored in terms of bytes (0s and 1s),but unlike text files, these bytes do not represent the ASCII values of characters. Rather, they represent the actual content such as image, audio, video, compressed versions of other files, executable files, etc. These files are not human readable. Thus, trying to open a binary file using a text editor will show some garbage values. We need specific software to read or write the contents of a binary file."
